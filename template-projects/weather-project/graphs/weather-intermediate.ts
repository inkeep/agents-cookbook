/**
 * Intermediate Weather Graph with Time Context
 * 
 * This agent extends the basic weather graph with a time context. To use this agent, you must have a timezone in the request context.
 * 
 * By passing in the timezone, the agent will fetch the current time and date and have it available when answering questions.
 * 
 * This enables the agent to answer more advanced questions about the weather, such as "what is the weather in Tokyo a week from now?"

// 1. Create the request schema
// You can find a timezone list here: https://github.com/davidayalas/current-time?tab=readme-ov-file
// Example: US/Pacific, US/Eastern, etc.
