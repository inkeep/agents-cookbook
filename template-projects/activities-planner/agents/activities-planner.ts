 * Activities Planner Agent
 *
 * This agent helps plan events in a given location by considering the weather forecast.
 *
 * This agent works by:
 * 1. Using the coordinates agent to get the coordinates of the specified location
 * 2. Passing those coordinates to the weather forecast agent to get the weather forecast for the next 24 hours
 * 3. Using the websearch agent to find good events based on the weather conditions
 *
 * Example usage:
 * "What are some good events in Tokyo?"
 * "What are some fun activities in Boston?"
